This tournament not only holds immense importance for our team but also provides an excellent platform to showcase our skills and represent our college at a competitive level.

I assure you that I am fully committed to maintaining my academic progress. I will make every effort to coordinate with my professors and teammates to minimize any disruptions caused by the tournament. I am willing to put in the necessary additional effort to catch up on missed classes or assignments promptly upon my return.

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and your consideration of my request. Your support and understanding of the significance of sports participation in my overall development would greatly contribute to my growth as an athlete and a well-rounded individual.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Should you require any additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at Phone Number or Email Address.
