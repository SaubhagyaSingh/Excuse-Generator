Subject: Request for Attendance Consideration Due to Mental Health Issues

Dear College Head's Name,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to inform you about the mental health challenges I am currently facing, which have significantly impacted my ability to attend college regularly. I kindly request your understanding and consideration regarding attendance policies, given my mental health condition.

Over the dates start_date - end_date , I have been grappling with mental health issues that have affected my overall well-being and ability to function optimally. Despite my best efforts to manage my mental health while attending college, there are times when the symptoms become overwhelming, making it extremely difficult for me to attend classes consistently.

I understand the importance of regular attendance and active participation in college activities. However, due to the unpredictable nature of my mental health condition, there are occasions when I am unable to attend classes as it would significantly compromise my mental well-being and hinder my ability to fully engage in the learning process.

I kindly request your understanding and consideration in providing me with some flexibility regarding attendance policies. This could include excusing occasional absences due to mental health reasons or exploring alternative methods of participation and learning, such as online resources, recorded lectures, or seeking notes from classmates, to help me maintain my academic progress despite my mental health challenges.

I want to assure you that I am fully committed to my education and will make every effort to stay on top of coursework and assignments, even when I am unable to attend classes. I am actively seeking professional help and engaging in therapy to manage my mental health condition effectively. I am in regular communication with my professors to seek their guidance and make appropriate arrangements for any missed material. I value my education and strive to excel in my studies, and I am actively working on improving my mental well-being to the best of my ability.

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and your consideration of my request. Your support and understanding during this challenging time would greatly assist me in managing my mental health while continuing to pursue my educational goals.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Should you require any additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at Phone Number or Email Address. I look forward to your favorable response and remain dedicated to my academic success within our college community.

Yours sincerely,

Your Name
