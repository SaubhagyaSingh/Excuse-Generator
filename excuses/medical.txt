Subject: Request for Attendance Consideration Due to Medical Issues

Dear College Head's Name,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to inform you about the medical challenges I am currently facing, which have significantly impacted my ability to attend college regularly. I kindly request your understanding and consideration regarding attendance policies, given my medical condition.

Over the past start_date - end_date, I have been dealing with a medical issue that has required ongoing treatment and care. Despite my best efforts to manage my health while attending college, there are instances when my condition deteriorates, making it extremely challenging for me to attend classes consistently.

I understand the importance of regular attendance and active participation in college activities. However, due to the unpredictable nature of my medical condition, there are times when I am physically unable to attend classes as it would jeopardize my health and well-being. These instances are beyond my control, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

I kindly request your understanding and consideration in providing me with some flexibility regarding attendance policies. This could include excusing occasional absences due to medical reasons or exploring alternative methods of participation and learning, such as online resources, recorded lectures, or seeking notes from classmates, to help me maintain my academic progress despite my medical challenges.

I want to assure you that I am fully committed to my education and will make every effort to stay up-to-date with coursework and assignments, even when I am unable to attend classes. I am in regular communication with my professors to seek their guidance and make appropriate arrangements for any missed material. I value my education and strive to excel in my studies, and I am actively working on managing my health to the best of my ability.

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and your consideration of my request. Your support and understanding during this challenging time would greatly assist me in managing my medical condition while continuing to pursue my educational goals.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Should you require any additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at Phone Number or Email Address. I look forward to your favorable response and remain dedicated to my academic success within our college community.

Yours sincerely,

Your Name
