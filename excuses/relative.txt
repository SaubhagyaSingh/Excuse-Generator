Subject: Request for Attendance Consideration Due to the Death of a Relative

Dear College Head's Name,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing to inform you about a personal tragedy that has recently occurred in my family. I regretfully share the news of the passing of a close relative, and I kindly request your understanding and consideration regarding attendance policies during this difficult time.

The loss of my beloved relative has left my family and me deeply devastated. As we navigate through this period of mourning and grief, it has become challenging for me to attend college regularly and focus on my studies. The emotional and practical responsibilities associated with this loss require my attention and presence with my family during this period of mourning.

I understand the importance of regular attendance and active participation in college activities. However, due to the profound impact of this loss on my emotional well-being and family obligations, I kindly request your understanding and compassion in providing me with some flexibility regarding attendance policies. This could include excusing my absences during this period of bereavement or exploring alternative methods of participation and learning, such as online resources, recorded lectures, or seeking notes from classmates, to help me maintain my academic progress during this challenging time.

I want to assure you that I remain fully committed to my education and will make every effort to catch up with coursework and assignments upon my return. I deeply value my education and understand the significance of the learning opportunities provided by our college. However, the circumstances surrounding the death of my relative demand my immediate attention and support for my family.

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and your consideration of my request. Your support and understanding during this time of bereavement would provide me with the necessary space and flexibility to navigate this personal loss while continuing to pursue my educational goals.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Should you require any additional information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at Phone Number or Email Address. I look forward to your favorable response and remain dedicated to my academic success within our college community.

Yours sincerely,

Your Name
